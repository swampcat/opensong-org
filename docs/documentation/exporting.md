# Exporting

## Set Export

The 'Export' button on the Set editing page allows you to export a set and all the songs in it to another folder, generally a USB stick, so that a set can edited on one machine and easily transported to another.

To use, click on the 'Export' button pick a folder to export to and hit 'Ok'. A 'Sets' and 'Songs' folder will be created and the files used for the 'Set' placed within them.
